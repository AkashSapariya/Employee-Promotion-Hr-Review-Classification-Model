# Employee-Promotion-Hr-Review-Classification-Model

The HR team stored data of the promotion cycle last year, which consists of details of all the employees in the company working last year and also if they got promoted or not, but every time this process gets delayed due to so many details available for each employee - it gets difficult to compare and decide.
So this time the HR team wants to utilize the stored data to make a model that will predict if a person is eligible for promotion or not.
